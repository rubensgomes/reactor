# reactor

A Java implementation of the Reactor/Aceptor design patterns used for networking connections.   This is a personal programming project developed by
[Rubens](http://www.rubens-gomes.com).

## Installation

- Download and install Apache Maven from:
```
    https://maven.apache.org/
```
- Clone the project from my GitHub:
```

```
## Build, Test and Deploy

- To set up an eclipse project:
```
    mvn -U eclipse:eclipse
```
- To run a java build:
```
    mvn -U install
```
- To run tests:
```
    mvn test
```
- To deploy build:
```
    mvn deploy
```
